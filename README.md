# Dashboard User

# Project Description:

The dashboard user management system is a web application built with React (Functional), React-Router, and Material UI. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing users' data, such as name, address, email, phone number, and more. The application has two screens: the Users Listing Page and the User Details Page. Users Listing Page contains a table that displays users' data, filtered by gender and nationality, with server-side pagination. The User Details Page displays detailed information about a specific user, accessible by clicking on the user's row in the Users Listing Page.
